# Logistic Regression PD Model (Credit Risk)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a Probability of Default (PD) model using Logistic Regression in Python.
The approach reflects methodologies commonly used in banks and financial institutions for credit risk assessment.

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
To estimate the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan using a binary classification model based on customer attributes.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and train-test split
4. Logistic Regression model development
5. Probability of Default (PD) estimation
6. Model performance evaluation

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- AUC Score
- KS Statistic
- Accuracy and Classification Report

---

## 🎯 Business Interpretation
- Higher PD values indicate higher credit risk
- The model supports credit approval decisions and risk-based pricing
- Relevant to Basel framework and IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)
